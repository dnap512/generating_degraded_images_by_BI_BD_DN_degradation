# Generating degraded images by BI,BD and DN degradation
This repository is for image generators that are degraded by **BI**, **BD** and **DN** methods **using python**.  
**BI** is bicubic interpolation downsampling method. And **DN**, **BD** degradation methods were introduced in [RDN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08797.pdf) paper.

It can be used for generating Super-resolution dataset with python.  


## Prerequisite
* python >=3.6  
* scipy==1.0.0  
* opencv-python

## How to
Just modify one directory path of HR images in this [code](https://github.com/dnap512/generating_degraded_images_by_BI_BD_DN_degradation/blob/master/generating_image_degraded__from_HR_to_BI_DN_BD.ipynb). That's all!
