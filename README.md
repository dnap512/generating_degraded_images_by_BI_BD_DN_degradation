# Generating degraded images by BI,BD and DN degradation
This repository is for image generators that are degraded by **BI**, **BD** and **DN** methods **using python**.  
**BI** is bicubic interpolation downsampling method. And **DN**, **BD** degradation methods were introduced in [RDN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08797.pdf) paper.


It can be used for generating Super-resolution dataset with python.  
All you have to just input directory path of HR images. That's all!

## Prerequisite
