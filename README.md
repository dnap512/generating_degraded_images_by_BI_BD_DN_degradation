# generating_degraded_images_by_BI_BD_DN_degradation
This repository is for image generators that are degraded by BI, BD and DN methods using python.  
BI is bicubic interpolation downsamplin method. And DN, BD degradation method was introduced in [RDN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08797.pdf) paper.


It can be used for generating Super-resolution dataset with python.  
All you have to just input directory path of HR images. That's all!
